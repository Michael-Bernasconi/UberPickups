\chapter{Introduction}
On-demand \textbf{private transportation services} (such as Uber) have become an indispensable and pervasive element of urban mobility in major global cities, with New York City standing out as one of the most dynamic operational markets. These services offer residents and visitors a flexible and efficient alternative to public transport and traditional taxis, significantly contributing to meeting the growing demand for personalized transportation.

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of this extensive dataset in order to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Understand the \textbf{spatial behavior} of demand, identifying the \textbf{key pickup points (\textit{hotspots})}.
    \item Analyze the \textbf{temporal trends} (hourly, daily and monthly) governing the flow of \textit{pickups}.
    \item Develop a \textbf{predictive model} to estimate \textbf{hourly pickup demand}, thereby supporting strategic decisions on fleet allocation across the city.
\end{enumerate}
